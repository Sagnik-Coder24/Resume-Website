# Resume Website (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)

This is a personal resume website built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The website is designed with a **dark theme** and **purple accents** to make the resume visually appealing and modern. It includes multiple sections such as personal info, skills, experience, and more, all with smooth animations.

This project allows you to easily update your resume's content by editing a single file (`assets/data.jsx`).

## Features

  - Personal Information
  - About Me / Summary
  - Skills
  - Work Experience
  - Education
  - Contact Me / Get in touch
- Links to social profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- Easily customizable and extendable.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation build tool that provides fast development server and optimized build process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and customizable user interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or above)
- **npm** or **yarn** (npm comes bundled with Node.js)

## Tailwind Customization

- You can update the animations and others by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- Tailwind's utility classes can be used throughout the app to adjust margins, padding, text sizes, colors, etc.

## Responsive Design

The website is built to be responsive out-of-the-box using Tailwind's responsive utilities. It adjusts gracefully across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Tailwindâ€™s breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) are used to ensure the content is displayed correctly on different screen sizes.
